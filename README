This is a script for a game called "Boggle" that I wrote as an exersice project for the course "Introduction To Computer Science".
Boggle is a word game where players try to find as many words as possible on a 4x4 grid of letters in a limited time.
The script uses the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI).
